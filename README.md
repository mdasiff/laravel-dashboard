# Laravel Dashboard with PHPUnit Test Case and Maximum Code Coverage

## Overview

This repository features a Laravel-based dashboard application designed with a focus on comprehensive testing and maximum code coverage. The project utilizes PHPUnit for unit testing and Xdebug for generating detailed HTML code coverage reports.

## Features

- **Laravel Dashboard**: A fully functional Laravel application serving as a dashboard.
- **PHPUnit Tests**: Includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the applicationâ€™s functionality.
- **Code Coverage**: Aims for maximum code coverage to validate the robustness of the application.
- **Xdebug Integration**: Generates pretty HTML reports for code coverage analysis.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mdasiff/laravel-dashboard.git
   cd laravel-dashboard
2. **Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have Composer installed. Run the following command to install the PHP dependencies:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
5. **Run Migrations**
Apply database migrations:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate

## Running Tests and generate code ceverage report in HTML Format
To run the PHPUnit tests and generate the code coverage report, use the following command:
```bash
php artisan test --coverage-html report
```
This command will execute the tests and create an `HTML` report in the coverage directory.
